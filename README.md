# Hello!
set dragon.count += 100
set dragon.experience = 100000000

## Recall what i said earlier...
Please, don't leave ANY issues, i'd rather have a job and enjoy my life, NOT all that _________ i've seen.

### You want to play Dungeons & Dragons, then this is the place for you...
set player.count += 1
set player.level = 1
set player.class = (fighter, wizard, cleric, rogue);

// When you decide you want to continue your adventuring, all you have to do is click the button clearly labeled.

#### You want to play something else, please leave ...
set dragon.kills += 1

##### This is the first of hopefully, many coding repositories ... 
Have plans to get involved with Linux a lot more. Until then, enjoy the gaming ... (pac man)
